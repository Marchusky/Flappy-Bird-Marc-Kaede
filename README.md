# Flappy Bird - Unity Game

## Introduction
This is a **Flappy Bird** clone made with Unity, for the subject of Mobile Devices.

## Features
- **Gravity and Flapping**: The bird falls due to gravity, and you can make it flap to rise by pressing a button.
- **Pipes**: Randomly spawned pipes move from right to left, providing obstacles to navigate.
- **Scoring**: A point is awarded each time the bird successfully passes through a pipe gap.
- **Death**: The bird dies and the game restarts if it hits a pipe, the ground, or flies too high.
- **Sound Effects**: Flapping, scoring, and death sounds are implemented.

## Controls
